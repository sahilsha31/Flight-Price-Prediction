Flight Price Prediction Using AI/ML
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices based on various factors such as departure and arrival times, source and destination cities, airline, and the number of stops. The goal is to help users make informed decisions when booking flights.

Features
Accurate Flight Price Predictions: The model uses historical flight data to predict the price of a flight based on selected parameters.
User-Friendly Interface: An easy-to-use web interface to input flight details and view predictions.
AI/ML Model: The model is trained on historical flight data to predict price variations.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Web Development: Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Visualization: Matplotlib (if applicable)
Version Control: Git, GitHub
